                        This will undoubtedly become one of the most-watched missions in the next decade as SpaceX plans to launch 12,000 communication satellites into Earth's orbit in the next year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plan has already ruffled feathers. Dark sky advocates are concerned the vast constellation of satellites could dampen our ability to peer out into the starry skies. Others have voiced concerns that the network could make Earth's orbit too crowded, potentially leading to crashes and, eventually our inability to leave the planet

                        The James Webb Space Telescope is set to be the successor to the Hubble Telescope and has a planned launch date of 2021, but that's after a long line of delays and setbacks. Webb will be launched with the assistance of the European Space Agency (ESA) who will provide an Ariane 5 rocket to set the Webb into orbit.

                        The Artemis mission will take astronauts to the Lunar South Pole to learn more about the availability of resources such as water and test vital technology that will prove useful during future missions to Mars. Another goal will be to, well, see how the human body endures long term space missions. They'll fly in the Orion spacecraft, which will be powered by the Agency's SLS rockets.

                        In March 2025, JAXA's Martian Moons Exploration probe will enter Mars orbit before moving on the Phobos to collect particles with a simple pneumatic system. The last attempt to nab a sample of Phobos was Russia's Fobos-Grunt mission in 2011 which failed in low-Earth orbit.

                        If successful, the spacecraft will return to Earth five years later, hopefully shedding light on whether Mars' moons are captured asteroids or the result of devastating planet impacts.

                        This highly anticipated mission to Saturn's icy moon, Titan. The rotorcraft is scheduled to launch in 2026 and is expected to arrive at Titan in 2034, when it will begin to study the moon's wide variety of environments.

                    <p>
                        Because Titan's atmosphere is so dense--four times that of Earth--Dragonfly will be able to carry its entire science payload to different locations around the ocean world for the 2.7-year mission. Titan has been likened to an early Earth analogue, so scientists hope the mission will inform our understanding of how life evolved here on our home planet.
